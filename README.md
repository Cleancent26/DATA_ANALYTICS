#### PROBLEM STATEMENTS
```
1. WHAT ARE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN DEFORETATION?
2. SHOW THE INCOME GROUPS OF COUNTRIES HAVING TOTAL AREA RANGING FROM
	75,000 TO 150,000 SQUARE METER
3.CALCULATE AVG. AREA IN SQUARE MILES FOR COUNTRIES IN THE 'UPPER MIDDLE INCOME REGION'
	COMPARE THE RESULT WITH THE REST OF THE CATEGORIES
4.DETERMINE THE TOTAL FOREST AREA IN SQUARE KM FOR COUNTRIES IN THE 'HIGH INCOME' GROUP
	COMPARE RESULT WITH THE REST OF THE INCOME CATEGORIES
5. SHOW COUNTRIES FROM EACH REGION (CONTINENT) HAVING THE HIGHEST TOTAL FOREST AREAS.
